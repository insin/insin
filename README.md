<h3>New</h3>
<ul>
<li>Replaced the extension icon with an ibis, better known in Australia as a "bin chicken" - sticking stuff on top of the Twitter icon (or something non-official which looks very, very like it) is against the Twitter Brand Guidelines</li>
<li>New "Home timeline" and 'Reduce "engagement"' sections in the options page - relevant options have been moved into these, including "Full-width timeline" and "Reduced interaction mode", which have been moved out of the Experiments section</li>
<li>Expanded support for Blue check replacement to more sections of the app:
<ul>
<li>Following/follower lists</li>
<li>Communities</li>
<li>Twitter Circle</li>
<li>Bookmarks</li>
<li>User typeahead dropdowns when composing a Tweet</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Community pages can now go full-width</li>
<li>Automatically switch from Verified to All in Notifications if Twitter forced you back onto Verified - this has started happening in the mobile web version</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changed</h3>
<ul>
<li>When you mute a Quote Tweet, emoji and linebreaks will now be preserved in the "Muted tweets" section in the options</li>
<li>Moved options for hiding algorithmic timeline content into the Experiments section, as they can cause performance issues by hiding large numbers of tweets</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Views not being hidden under tweets on the largest device widths supported by Twitter's mobile view</li>
<li>Fixed user profile page detection to be independent of display language - it wasn't working for many non-English display languages</li>
<li>Fixed Blue check replacement in various places:
<ul>
<li>on "user liked/retweeted" notifications (again)</li>
<li>in the user profile header and verified badge popup on mobile</li>
<li>in search result dropdowns in Search/Explore on mobile</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed some cases where hiding Blue checks would hide more than it should, e.g. the entire user name in "like" notifications</li>
<li>Fixed Blue subscribers with locked accounts having the locked account icon replaced too</li>
<li>Fixed "What's happening" appearing in the sidebar on the Suggested Communities page</li>
<li>Fixed tabs on other pages setting the title to "Home" on mobile if you navigate from Home to another tabbed page when the Retweets tab is being displayed</li>
<li>Fixed the sticky hover state on the Retweets tab on mobile</li>
<li>Fixed the Retweets tab showing tweets from the last tab you had open, instead of from Following</li>
</ul>
<h3>Removed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Removed all code related to the old "Sparkle button" timeline, which was continuing to cause problems for some people</li>
